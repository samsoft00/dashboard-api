1. Add Test to dashboard
    - User
    - Loan
    - Fx Order
2. Drop invoice_no column, use reference_no instead
3. Increase fx order reference number
4. 

 // User
 1. throw error if user email is valid
 2. Admin should be able to add user

it('store the credentials to file', (done) => {});
it('return user payload using auth token', (done) => {});
it('should refresh token', (done) => {});
it('should reset password', (done) => {});



TASKS:
1. Generating refrence number (ticket ID) serially (e.g. 5000 > 5001 > 5002 etc). - 

We need an API that allows us get dashboard users by department, we need to trim down the list for assigning both for loans and fx, because right now, the loan officers can't see one of their supervisors on the list because it is only showing 20.

I have experience working with the following languages/Framework Javascript (Nodejs) with Typescript and a bit Reactjs, Golang though I started my career using Php in 2014.

Move to Javascript after some months, spend night watching Youtube video, reading examples on github, I love using JavaScript because it’s such an elegant language with so many purposes, I have developed core banking application and other internal tool using Nodejs.

At the beginning of this year (2021), i started looking into Golang, because of its fast, scalable and secure for web development, started by picking ebooks on packtpub.com, then start contributing to open sources using the knowledge I've gain.

I like to bring ideas to life through code.

I watched my first python tutorial with the intention of creating games. But the more I learned about programming, the more intrigued I became with all of its facets, and I took it upon myself to learn more about coding. Some of my strengths include:
* Fullstack Software Development
* Website/App Development
* Setting up software architecture

Additionally, I have experience with project management, leading a team, hiring new employees and managing all client interactions throughout the project workflow.

As CTO of Inheaden - a software consulting and IT startup based in Darmstadt - I’ve handled many client projects, and one of my favourites has to be the Grovy app. We developed this hybrid application that runs on a serverless platform on a big cloud provider in just 8 weeks, from the concept stage to a final, usable product. I have also had the tremendous joy of watching my team grow from 2 members to 8 in just over a year, and we are constantly juggling anywhere between 2 to 4 projects at a time.

As a self-taught programmer, I’ve learned that tutorials are important but practice makes the most tangible difference. Starting your coding journey can be daunting but once you begin, chances are you’ll never look back, just like me. I started with python, which is great for any beginner, but I am also proficient in:
* TypeScript
* Golang
* Java
* C#

Coding is my passion. The goal is to amass both knowledge and experience so I can coach and guide others as they provide valuable services and bring their own projects to life. When I’m not working, I enjoy working out, swimming or listening to a good audiobook.
